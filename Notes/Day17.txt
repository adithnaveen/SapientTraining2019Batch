			Routing is an integral part of a microservice architecture. For example, / may be mapped to your web application, /api/users is mapped to the user service and /api/shop is mapped to the shop service. Zuul is a JVM-based router and server-side load balancer from Netflix.

				Netflix uses Zuul for the following:

				Authentication
				Insights
				Stress Testing
				Canary Testing
				Dynamic Routing
				Service Migration
				Load Shedding
				Security
				Static Response handling
				Active/Active traffic management
